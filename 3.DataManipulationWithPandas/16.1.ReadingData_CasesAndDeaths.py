# Problem:
'''
You are working with the 'ca-covid' CSV file that contains the COVID-19 infection data in California for the year 2020.
The file provides data on daily cases and deaths for the entire year.
Find and output the row that corresponds to December 31, 2020.

NOTE: The requested date is the last row in the dataset, so you can use indexing to select it.
