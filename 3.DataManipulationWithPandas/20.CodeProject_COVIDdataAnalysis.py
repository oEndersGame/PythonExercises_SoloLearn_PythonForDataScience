# Problem:
'''
You are working with the COVID dataset for California, which includes the number of cases and deaths for each day of 2020.
Find the day when the deaths/cases ratio was largest.

To do this, you need to first calculate the deaths/cases ratio and add it as a column to the DataFrame with the name 'ratio', then find the row that corresponds to the largest value.

NOTE: The output should be a DataFrame, containing all of the columns of the dataset for the corresponding row.

# CODE:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("/usercode/files/ca-covid.csv")

df.drop('state', axis=1, inplace=True)
df.set_index('date', inplace=True)

df["ratio"] = df["deaths"] / df["cases"]
max_ratio = df.loc[df["ratio"] == df["ratio"].max()]

print(max_ratio)
